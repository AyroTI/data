Data.js
=====================

Data.js is a data representation framework for Javascript. It's being developed in the context of Substance, an open publishing platform.


With Data.js you can:
---------------------

* Model your domain data using a simple graph-based object model that can be serialized to JSON.
* Traverse your graph, including relationships using a simple API.
* Manipulate and query data on the client (browser) or on the server (Node.js) by using exactly the same API.


Features
---------------------

* `Data.Graph` (A data abstraction for all kinds of linked data)
* Persistence (You an persist your data to different data-stores)
* Replication Graphs can be synchronized with remote
* Versioning (Every graph operation is remembered and can be reverted)
